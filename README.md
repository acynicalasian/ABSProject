# H1 Overview
This is a project I made for an interview. I'll get to writing better documentation when I can, but for now, here's a quick reminder to run `npm install` in `./tmo-react` to install all the dependencies of this project.

# H2 Third-party libraries
I used Material UI, a UI component library that supports CSS-in-JS by using Emotion. I also have Storybook installed in this project for now, but I'll probably get rid of it as I wasn't able to make use of its features effectively.

# H2 To-do
As of now, I need to finish the component that actually displays the top seller data in a table, and after that, I just need to write unit tests for the front-end. After that, I'm mostly finished, and I'll update this documentation if I have time.
